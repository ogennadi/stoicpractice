        <dd>an insurance company breaches its duty of good faith and fair dealing if it intentionally denies, fails to
            process or pay a claim without a reasonable basis. Further, [t]he carrier has an obligation to immediately
            conduct an adequate investigation, act reasonably in evaluating the claim, and act promptly in paying a
            legitimate claim. It should do nothing that jeopardizes the insured's security under the policy. It should
            not
            force an insured to go through needless adversarial hoops to achieve its rights under the policy. It cannot
            lowball claims or delay claims hoping that the insured will settle for less. Equal consideration of the
